## 🔧 Payment Flow

### Stripe Flow:
```
Customer enters card → StripeCardForm → /api/payment/stripe 
→ Creates Payment Intent → Confirms card payment 
→ Order Created → Redirect to success page
```

### PayPal Flow:
```
Customer clicks PayPal → PayPalButton → Creates PayPal order
→ PayPal popup → Customer approves 
→ Captures payment → Order Created → Redirect to success page
```

## 📊 Payment Settings Structure

```json
{
  "type": "payment",
  "stripe": {
    "enabled": true,
    "publishableKey": "pk_test_xxx",
    "secretKey": "sk_test_xxx",
    "webhookSecret": "whsec_xxx"
  },
  "paypal": {
    "enabled": true,
    "clientId": "AYourPayPalClientID",
    "clientSecret": "EYourPayPalSecret",
    "mode": "sandbox" // or "live"
  }
}
```

## 🎨 UI Components

### Payment Method Tabs
- **Material:** HeroUI `Tabs` component
- **Variants:** Bordered tabs with primary color
- **Dynamic:** Only shows tabs for enabled gateways
- **Responsive:** Works on mobile and desktop

### Stripe Card Form
- Split card elements (number, expiry, CVC)
- Validation for billing details
- Loading states during payment
- 3D Secure support

### PayPal Button

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Environment vs Admin Settings
- **Old Way:** Payment keys in `.env` file
- **New Way:** Payment keys in admin panel (database)
- **Benefit:** Change keys without redeploying

### Security
- ✅ Secret keys stored server-side only
- ✅ Publishable keys safe in frontend
- ✅ Payment gateway validation before processing
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed to client

### Testing
- **Stripe Test Mode:** Use `pk_test_` and `sk_test_` keys
- **PayPal Sandbox:** Select "Sandbox" mode in admin
- **Live Payments:** Use live keys and "Live" mode

### Error Handling
- Missing billing details → Shows field errors
- Payment fails → Shows error message
- Order creation fails → Redirects to failure page
- No gateway configured → Shows graceful message

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Multi-Gateway Support**: Accept both card and PayPal payments
2. **No Crashes**: Works even without payment gateway
3. **User Choice**: Customers pick their preferred method
4. **Easy Setup**: Admin configures from dashboard
5. **Flexible**: Enable/disable gateways anytime
6. **Scalable**: Easy to add more gateways (Razorpay, etc.)
